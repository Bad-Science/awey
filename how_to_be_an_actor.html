			<h4>act 1.</h4>
			<p>
				it's the day before the first warm day of spring.
				chaos and uncertainty permeate the air of everyone's every breath.
				you watch, probably too closely, as the disarray and cost of measuring progress by GDP breaks the web and everyone in it.
				and you soon realize what you always knew, who we are, and where we were always going:
				why you started down this bizzare path in the first place...
				<br><br>
				<i>we are the web. and the computer</i><b> will </b><i>love the sunset.</i>

				<div class="quote">
					"All the world's a stage,<br>
					And al l the men and women merely actors.<br>
					They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
					And one man in his time plays many parts."<br>
					<br>
					<i>- Shakespeare, aqb c.h.</i>
				</div>
			</p>

			<p>
				you smoke a bowl, finally sleep, and when you wake, you realize two more things.
				1. that you weren't hallucinating after all, and 2. what it is that you are truly missing in your life:
				<br><br>
				<i>a nice way to write javascript.</i>
				<br><br>
				if you had only had a nice way to write javascript, everything in your life would be different.
				all of your problems, personal, professional, and spiritual would be solved.
				the world would be a better place. you would be, dare i say, happy.
				<br><br>
				and i don't just mean, like, serving responses web requests, i think that's a very well solved problem.
				i'm talking, parallelism, ipc, distributed systems.
				i'm talking better abstractions than threads, i'm talking and workers and queues and stores and clusters, and i'm talking
				one consistent paradigm to achieve well factored code in a single yavascript application to do all those things.
				one consistent, singular pattern for implementing all of those things and whatever you can dream of with as little friction as possible.
				i'm talking managing state across clients and servers, and doing so with joy and confidence.
				i'm talking about elegant, parallel, type-safe, distributed programming in yavascript. oh please, oh please can i have it?
				<br><br>
				i want to do all these things in, what at least looks like, a single javascript application, elegantly, consistently,
				without an endless chain of dependencies, like you can in virtually every other mainstream language out there.
				<br><br>
				
				<div class="quote">
					impossible, you might say. but everything, my dear, is theoretically impossible, until it is done.
				</div>
			</p>

			<p>
				alright, fine, i don't know if i'll succeed, or if anyone will care or agree, but i'll be damned if i start another greenfield web project without
				at least trying. i've spent too many years believing i coudln't do anything at all to believe anything other than anything can be done,
				and done well.
			</p>

				<div class="quote">
					"I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I
						was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why,
						sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."
					<br><br>
					<i>- Lewis Carroll, aqb c.h.</i>
				</div>
			<p>
				one day i'll eat breakfast again. and on that day, i'll have learned how to be an aCtor in yavascript.
			</p>

			<h3>what does it mean to be an aCtor in yavascript?</h3>
			<p>
				it's warm now, but you recall yesterday, the last day it was cold.
				you're interviewing for a job you really need, so far it's been the best interview cycle you've ever done, 
				you're on the last round, and the cto asks you to split some data. just, split up some json data by disk size in javascript.
				but you stayed up too late making your code pretty, you've been dealing with some stuff lately,
				and you just fumble around loops like a freshman.
				and, eventually, you get there, but it was <i>ugly</i>. if you hadn't demonstrated your systems knowledge well in the
				previous portion of the interview, it would have been a definite no. but it's gone from a slam dunk to a risk of default.
				you've shown weakness, and somehow you know it wasn't your fault.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>
				cto can see you are tired, and clearly having a tough day, so once you're there, cto simply asks:
				"and how might we get the result, of each next chunk, without waiting for the last?"
				<br><br>
				huh? you think... b.. but this is javascript... yeah i guess i could wrap then in a generator, or promisified callbacks but...
				we're still processing a sequence of data, javascript is single threaded, soooo who cares?
				after a few more words exchanged back and forth, you realize he is asking you to parallelize the solution, but, you don't
				even really think hard about it, because you are working in a <i>single threaded environment without memory sharing</i>.
				<br><br>
				<i>
					without an ergonimic way to write arbitrary parallel or distributed programs within the context you were working,
					your mind did not even consider a parallel solution.
				</i>
				<br><br>
				you always wanted it, but it was only upon reflecting on that moment you <i>knew</i> you <i>needed</i> a way to write ergonimc,
				parallel or distributed code within the context of a 'single javascript application'. and that you simply did not have one.
				<br><br>
				and perhaps most importantly, that having such a thing, meant <b><i>being an aCtor in yavascript</i></b>
